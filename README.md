# SurfsUp
This is the assignment for module 10. 

The folder contains three parts in total, with 'climate_stater.ipynb' and 'app.py' being the scripts for part 1 and part 2, respectively. The 'Resources' folder contains the necessary data files. 

To run the code smoothly, please make sure to install the Flask module in advance using "pip install Flask." If you encounter installation issues, you can create a Python 3 environment using "conda create --name <envname>" and then proceed with the installation.

When running 'app.py,' you will see a local development server URL with IP address and a port number in the output, such as "http://<IP address>:<port number>", so the URL to access the application should be: "<the URL from the output>/subpath."
